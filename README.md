# Penba

Build message driven single page applications with Pemba üê¶
#### Motivation

This project is and continues to be a learning experience to understand how the tools I use to build client side applications work under the hood aka React, Redux and the rest...

It all started here: [https://github.com/hexacta/didact](didact)
### Pemba Bolt-ons

Opinionated bolt on modules for state management, side effects and routing.

- Pembax
- Pemba Router

### Message Driven Communication

With Pemba building the UI is based on the same arhitecture of React but managing state and side effects takes an opionated approach using a Message Driven architecture.

## Useage

‚ò†Ô∏è Don't use in production projects...

Add it with Yarn or NPM:

```bash
yarn add pemba
```
