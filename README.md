# Penba

Build message driven single page applications with Pemba üê¶
#### Motivation

This project is and continues to be a learning experience to understand how the tools I use to build client side applications work under the hood aka React, Redux and the rest...

It all started here: [https://github.com/hexacta/didact](didact)

Pemba is a set of libraries that enable you to build single page applications using a message driven achitecture. 

### Message Driven Communication

With Pemba building the UI is based on the same architecture of React but managing state and side effects takes an opionated approach using messages.

### Pemba Bolt-ons

Opinionated bolt on modules for state management, side effects and routing.
