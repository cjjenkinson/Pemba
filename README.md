# Pemba

#### Motivation

This project is and continues to be a learning experience to understand how the tools I use to build client side applications work under the hood aka React, Redux and the rest...

It all started here: [react didact](https://github.com/hexacta/didact)

### Message Driven Communication

With Pemba building the UI is based on the same architecture of React but managing state and side effects takes an opionated approach using messages.

## Useage

☠️ Don't use in production projects...

Add it with Yarn or NPM:

```bash
yarn add pemba
```
